<h2>About us</h2>
<p>New Hope Rescue Center is a not-for-profit organization dedicated to saving the
lives of homeless pets and finding them new, forever homes. All donations go toward this goal. The pets at our rescue
are saved from many different humane societies around the state. We do not take direct 
owner surrenders.<br><br>
The New Hope Rescue Center was founded in 1977 when Maya Goodall and Rachel Harris
fostered their first dog, Luke. Luke, who they ended up adopting, helped them discover
their love for animals. Hundreds of fosters and many years later, New Hope grew into
the fully-fledged rescue organization it is today. The organization is now run by
Rachel's son, Steven Harris, but Maya and Rachel still visit to keep the animals 
(and Steven) company.</p>
<h2>Pets at New Hope</h2>
<p>All of our adoptable pets are up-to-date on shots and spayed or neutered when applicable.
If a puppy or kitten is too young to be fixed at the time of adoption, New Hope will
provide you with a spay/neuter voucher valid at most local veterinany offices.
Some of our pets are kept on location, while others are kept in foster homes, so be
sure to contact us by phone or E-mail to arrange an appointment to meet a pet.<br>
The adoption fee for dogs is $100, for puppies, $150.<br>
The adoption fee for cats is $75, for kittens, $125.<br>
We take cash and credit.</p>
