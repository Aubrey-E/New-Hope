<h2>Pet Adoption Help and FAQ</h2>
<p>Adopting a pet is an easy process. If you see an adoptable pet on our site
that you're interested in, call or E-mail us to set up an appointment to meet the
pet. You will need to fill out a short adoption form in person. Then, if you decide
 to adopt, you can bring your new friend home on that day.</p>
<dl>
<dt>What should I do before adopting a pet?</dt>
<dd>Before adopting, you should realize that adopting a pet is a commitment. You
should plan to take care of that pet for the rest of its life. Make sure owning a
pet is right for you, and if you're not sure, do some research to find out if a
cat or dog, and which breed of dog, would best fit your lifestyle.</dd>
<dt>What should I have before bringing a dog home?</dt>
<dd>We suggest having these supplies or buying them soon after bringing home a dog:
A leash and collar, dog food, bowls for food and water, a kennel,
 heartworm and flea and tick prevention, treats, and toys.</dd>
<dt>What should I have before bringing a cat home?</dt>
<dd>We suggest having these supplies or buying them soon after bringing home a cat:
Cat food, bowls for food and water, a cat carrier for transportation, a collar and
 flea and tick prevention if the cat will be going outside, treats, and toys.</dd>
 <dt>What should I bring to my adoption appointment?</dt>
 <dd>Bring as many members of the family as you can to meet your new family member!
 If you have other pets, consider bringing them to make sure your new pet will 
get along with them. If you are adopting a cat, it would be best if you brought
a cat carrier for transportation, but if you do not own one yet, we can lend you
one.</dd>
<dt>Why should my pets be spayed/neutered?</dt>
<dd>Spaying and neutering helps to decrease the population of unwanted, homeless pets 
in animal shelters and rescues. There are also many benefits to to having your pet
 spayed or neutered.
